# What #
Case study to demonstrate the skills and technologies learned during a 10 week traing with TEKsystems.
We are learning Java and Spring MVC

# Project Title #
Cedar Drone

# Idea #
The website is for drone/quad copter reviews.  It's target audience would be drone enthusiasts and those in the market for a drone

Early on in the traing when we were first made aware about a cap-stonesque project I was wavering between a couple ideas.  My considerations were in regards to whether or not I could feasibly develop the project in the given amount of time and how I could come up with an idea to meet the requirments.

Little thought was put in to this for the first few weeks as I had no reference point for the effort and time that would be required to develop within the (at the time) to be learned technologies.  I settled with a vague notion to build "a drone website" to appease some deadlines for having an idea and went along beginning to learn the course content. 

In the first 8 weeks I payed very little to no attention to the case-study as the class was moving very rapidly through learning Java SQL and some peripheral tools and technologies.  It would have been a fruitless endeavor to try and implement anything on a case study project when I was doing bite sized test projects daily on the given content, most of the time in a vacuum.  As it were, the isolated concepts were not fitting together to make meaningful progress on a project that was to be "full-stack" in scope, and so I opted to spend effort understanding what was being delivered as it came instead of laboring on my case study.  

In week 8 is when I started to think about the database design for the project and came up with the minimum 4 tables I would need to meet a technical requirment.  This was a short lived jaunt as the introduction of Spring seemed to increase the complexity of what we were doing and the pace of subject content seems to increase in kind.  

It's the end of week 9 and Alas! I've spent no more time on my case-study but have gained a level of comfort with what we began to learn, with emphasis on getting data from a client in jsp and getting it to my backend and stored in a db.  The current focus is retrieving data from the db and displaying it to the user.  I'm struggling with the moving parts of SpringMVC yet and how it's all fitting together, monkey see monkey do at this point.  Don't ask me the about the "why's" just yet.
